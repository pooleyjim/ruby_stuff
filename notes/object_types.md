# Object types in Ruby.

Everything in Ruby is an object.

Objects can be thought of as real world items but also abstract items such as a conversation.

Variables are an exception which are used to store or reference an object.

Assign variables with understandable names and in lower case:

```ruby
my_first_variable = 1
my_second_variable = 2
```

###### Variable Scope:

Scope    | notation
---------|-----------
Global   | $var_name
Class    | @@var_name
Instance | @var_name
Local    | var_name
Block    | var_name
